<b>Basic Ideas</b>
In-Place Algorithm:
An in-place algorithm is an algorithm that does not need an extra space and produces an output in the same memory that contains the data by transforming the input ‘in-place’. However, a small constant extra space used for variables is allowed.
Stable Algorithm:
A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal or same keys appear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input array to be sorted.
Auxiliary Space Complexity:
Auxiliary Space is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm.
Space Complexity:
Space Complexity of an algorithm is total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input.
